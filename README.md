# Sinatra-Bootrap 
Sinatra-bootsrap is a simple starting point for people who want to build a sinatra app with Twitter Bootstrap. 

# To install:
The app installs like any other ruby app
> bundle install

# To run app (with shotgun):
This will run the app using shotgun which updates the router (web.rb) when it is modified

NOTE: Ensure you have shot gun, if you don't you can install like so
> gem install shotgun

> shotgun web.rb
> go to locoalhost:[port #]


# To run app (without shotgun):
To run the app normally run it like any other sinatra app, like so
> ruby web.rb
> go to localhost:[port #]
